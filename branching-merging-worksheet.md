# What I learned about branching and merging

> Use the attached worksheet to practice the concepts of branching and merging. 

Actions you need to perform are marked with `- [ ]` replace the space with an `x` when you complete the action.

- [ ] Before you start, create a new git repo and add the worksheet to it:

```bash
cd source/repos
mkdir branching-merging
cd branching-merging
git init
cp ~/Downloads/branching-merging-worksheet.md .
git add .
git commit -m "Add branching-merging-worksheet.md"
```


## Branching

### Definition

- [ ] In your own words define what is branching

> Your definition goes here

- [ ] Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Define what is branching"
```


### Why branch

- [ ] List at least three reasons why you would use branches in a project

> Your list goes here
> 1.
> 2.
> 3.

- [ ] Commit your changes - remember to use a descriptive message

### How to create a branch

To create a branch we run the following commands: 

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
git switch <branch-name>
```


- [ ] Briefly describe what each command does:

> Your description goes here
> 
- [ ] Create a new branch called `feature-1` and switch to it
- [ ] Did your working copy change? Why or why not?

> Your answer goes here

- [ ] Commit your changes
- [ ] Switch back to main
- [ ] Did you notice any changes in the working copy after the commit? Why or why not?
> Your answer goes here
 
**Oh no!** 
If you did everything correctly, your answer to the previous question is gone! Haha.

Don't worry, we can get it back. But first:

- [ ] Commit your changes to the main branch


### Merging changes

- [ ] What is merging?
> Your answer goes here

- [ ] What is a merge conflict?
> Your answer goes here

When there is a merge conflict, you need to resolve it before you can merge the changes. Git will mark the conflicted files, and you need to manually resolve the conflicts â€“ that is, edit the files to remove the conflict markers and make the changes you want to keep. Here's an example of a file with a merge conflict:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Text from the version in the HEAD (main) branch
=======
Text from the version in the feature-1 branch
>>>>>>> feature-1
```


- [ ] How do you resolve a merge conflict?
> Your answer goes here

- [ ] Attempt to merge the `feature-1` branch into `main`:

```bash
git merge feature-1
```

- [ ] Did it work? Why or why not?

> Your answer goes here

Before you can merge, you need to commit any changes in your working copy (or stash, but we'll talk about that later)

- [ ] Commit your changes
- [ ] Attempt to merge the `feature-1` branch into `main` again
- [ ] Did it work? Why or why not? If a merge succeeded, what was the merge strategy used? If there was a merge conflict, resolve it.
  
> Describe the merge strategy used and the result of the merge

- [ ] Commit your changes and/or resolve the merge conflict

### Deleting branches

- [ ] Delete the `feature-1` branch:
```bash
git branch -d feature-1
```

### Looking back

We can look into the past and see the evolution of our project using the git log command. There are several useful options to the git log command, such as --oneline, --graph, --decorate, --all, --since, --until, --author, --grep, --no-merges, --reverse, and many others.

We'll use a couple of popular options to see the history of our project.

- [ ] Run the following commands:

```bash 
git log
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```
- [ ] Briefly describe the output of each command

> Your description goes here

- [ ] Commit your changes
- [ ] Reflect on what you learned about branching and merging. What was the most challenging part? What was the most interesting part?

> Your reflection goes here

**Done!**
Or are you? There are always new changes to commit ;)
